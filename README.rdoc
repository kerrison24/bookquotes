Feature ideas:

- add users
- rethink the necessity for upvoting/downvoting
- users should be able to save their favourite quotes
- users should be able to view quotes posted by them
- provide a link of the book on amazon
- upvoting/downvoting, can only be done by users logged in and can only manipulate it by 1 value
